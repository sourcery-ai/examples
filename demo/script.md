# First step if possible:

# Do you code in Python?

# Can we use your laptop for the demo?

# Get them to install Sourcery on their laptop
# Sign up for a free token
# Then show them the first refactoring
# Then ask if we can scan their code for refactorings and clones and explore them

# then can scan for refactorings, look for clones, etc.



# Start by manually typing this and saying something along the lines of:
# Sourcery works with you as you type to suggest improvements to your code
# Here's a quick example:
def first_demo(condition):
    if condition:
        if condition:
            print('Brilliant')
